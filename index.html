        <div class="intro">
            <p>Japan is home to many impressive castles. While some are recreations of older castles, many of them were built hundreds of years ago and have survived to this day. The following castles are a selection of some of the most impressive and famous.</p>

                <h4>Matsumoto Castle</h4>
                <img src="images/matsumoto__castle.jpg">
                <p>Matsumoto Castle (松本城, Matsumotojō) is one of the most complete and beautiful among Japan's original castles. It is a "hirajiro" - a castle built on plains rather than on a hill or mountain. Matsumoto Castle is unique for having both a secondary donjon and a turret adjoined to its main keep. The castle structures, in combination with their characteristic black wainscoting, give off an air of grandeur and poise.</p>

                <h4>Inuyama Castle</h4>
                <img src="images/inuyama__castle.jpg">
                <p>Inuyama Castle (犬山城, Inuyamajō) was initially constructed in 1537, and its donjon is one of Japan's oldest extant. It is one of only twelve original castles left in Japan (i.e. castles that have survived intact the natural disasters and wars since the end of the feudal age in 1867). Inuyama Castle is also one of only five castles whose main keeps have been designated as national treasures. The other four are Himeji Castle, Matsumoto Castle, Hikone Castle and Matsue Castle.</p>

                <h4>Hikone Castle</h4>
                <img src="images/hikone__castle.jpg">
                <p>After a construction period of twenty years, Hikone Castle (彦根城, Hikonejō) was completed in 1622. The hilltop castle served as the seat of the Ii daimyo (feudal lords) until the end of the feudal age in 1868. Hikone Castle is an original castle, i.e. it survived the post feudal era without undergoing destruction and reconstruction. Besides the castle's main keep, most of the inner moats, walls, guard houses and gates also remain intact. Furthermore, parts of the castle's palace buildings have been reconstructed, giving visitors a good impression of a relatively complete Japanese feudal castle.</p>

                <img src="images/himeji__castle.jpg">
                <p>Himeji Castle (姫路城, Himejijō), also known as White Heron Castle (Shirasagijo) due to its elegant, white appearance, is widely considered as Japan's most spectacular castle for its imposing size and beauty and its well preserved, complex castle grounds. The castle is both a national treasure and a world heritage site. Unlike many other Japanese castles, it was never destroyed by war, earthquake or fire and survives to this day as one of the country's twelve original castles. The castle recently underwent extensive renovation over several years and was fully re-opened to the public in March 2015.</p>

                <img src="images/osaka__castle.jpg">
                <p>The construction of Osaka Castle (大阪城, Ōsakajō) started in 1583 on the former site of the Ishiyama Honganji Temple, which had been destroyed by Oda Nobunaga thirteen years earlier. Toyotomi Hideyoshi intended the castle to become the center of a new, unified Japan under Toyotomi rule. It was the largest castle at the time.</p>

                <p>Okayama Castle (岡山城, Okayamajō), also known as "crow castle" due to its black exterior, was built in 1597 in the style of the Azuchi-Momoyama Period. The original castle was destroyed in the last year of World War 2, but a reconstruction was made in 1966. The castle is located on the Asahi River, which was used as a moat. Korakuen Garden is located just across the river.</p>

                <p>Hiroshima Castle (広島城, Hiroshimajō), also called the Carp Castle, is a good example of a castle built on a plain in the center of a city as opposed to hilltop and mountaintop castles. Its main keep is five stories tall, and its grounds are surrounded by a moat. Also within the castle's precincts are a shrine, some ruins and a few reconstructed buildings of the Ninomaru (second circle of defense).</p>

                <p>Nagoya Castle (名古屋城, Nagoyajō) was built in the beginning of the Edo Period as the seat of one of the three branches of the ruling Tokugawa family, the Owari branch. As such, it was one of the largest castles in the country, and the castle town around it ultimately grew to become Japan's fourth largest city.</p>

                <p>A city district of Naha today, Shuri is the name of the former capital of the Ryukyu Kingdom. Shuri Castle (首里城, Shurijō) served as the administrative center and residence of the Ryukyu kings for several centuries until Okinawa became a Japanese prefecture in 1879. The castle is included as one of the UNESCO World Heritage designated Castles of the Ryukyu Kingdom sites.</p>
